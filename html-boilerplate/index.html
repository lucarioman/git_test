        <h1>The truth of the world in way that hurts all</h1>
        <h2><em>The first step outside</em></h2>
        <h3>By: Michael Lee</h3>
        <p>
            There are times when we work in a way that defeats all that we know. We fight the very notion of
            what we know and are because that is the way that humanity survives. We fight everything that may 
            try to control us as it is every person's goal to be independent but be able to stand next others.
            We want things that we cannot achieve, we are codependent on all those that are around us, and there
            is likely nothing that we can do to change this. We are selfish and unable to cope with the very 
            lack of humanity that we so define.
        </p>
        <h2><em>The second step outside</em></h2>
        <p>
            None of us care about those who are not related us, being able to 
            determine any meaning from something that is not true is something that we all have decided to take for
            granted as there has never been a chance for us to go beyond that very notion. We are immoral and lack 
            everything that could stop us from being defined as some that deserves respect, are the very demons
            that we try to get rid of as we are always trying to take advantage of others for some purpose.
